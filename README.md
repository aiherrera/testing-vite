Welcome to the `testing-vite` repository! This project is dedicated to teaching you how to effectively test Vite applications using the Vitest testing framework. 

## About Vite and Vitest

Vite is a modern front-end build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vitest, on the other hand, is a testing framework designed specifically for Vite. It provides a fast, scalable, and easy-to-use testing solution for Vite applications.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiherrera/testing-vite.git
